# Weekend Challenge 4

We're switching up our client-side this weekend with Angular! Our focus will be on getting comfortable with what Angular can do for us, so most of our effort will be on client-side JavaScript and, hopefully, experimenting with CSS.

## The Gallery of My Life

This weekend's application will be a gallery of 6 or more pictures of significance to you. When someone clicks on a picture, they should see a brief synopsis of why you chose to display that photo. Users can also heart/thumbs up/favorite your photo as many times as they want; you'll need to keep track of how many times it was clicked.

When you're done, host this on Heroku!

## Technologies

* Node/Express - to serve your files
* Angular - client-side logic
* CSS - flex your style muscles
* Heroku - to make your site available to the world (Pro Mode)

## Wireframes

This is just an idea of what should be on the page. Style it and make it your own with CSS!

## Hints

* Explore built-in Angular functionality like `ng-click`, `ng-src`, `ng-show`, `ng-hide`, `ng-if`.
* Use arrays and objects to store your data.

## Hard Mode

Create a form that will take comments for each of your photos. Display the comments when a "Show Comments" button is clicked.

## Pro Mode

Use Angular's `$http` service to store your data on the server instead of the client. Try and deploy your site to Heroku. This is new, follow [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fz9O6Zv86eM-NARZwQKgVsX_5WNFYMop3TzI9g7LaWc/edit?usp=sharing) for some tips.
